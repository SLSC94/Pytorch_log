Currently, I am learning Pytorch and would want to understand the framework in detail, with the eventual goal of implementing models such as LSTMs/CNNs/GANs.

I'm using the resource https://seba-1511.github.io/tutorials/index.html, and will aim to go through and record what I've learnt from each exercise.
